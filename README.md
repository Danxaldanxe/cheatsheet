#Commandline Cheatsheets
Everybody likes cheatsheets. If you're like me and using lots of different tools but can't remember all those cool shortcuts.

Sure, there are lots of PDFs out there with everything you need. But are you really gonna have an PDF reader next to your terminal and look shortcuts up? Come on, who are we kidding?

I'm trying to solve that problem by putting the cheatsheets where they belong. The terminal you're working in!

- Cheatsheets directly in your terminal
- Open-Format so you can customize/add/share
- Grep-able!

##Requirements
Nothing but good old Python 3.

##Installation
To use, clone this repository to ```~/cheat.d```. Like so:

```https://github.com/martialblog/cheatsheet.git ~/cheat.d```

For usability you can set an alias.

```alias cheat="python3 ~/cheat.d/cheat.py"```

And of you go!

```user@computer$ cheat git```

##TODO
A lot of stuff... I just started. Stay tuned.

- Add more cheatsheets! MORE!
- Clean up imports
- Maybe categories?
- Tell my mom about it
